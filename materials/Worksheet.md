# 🧪 Disease Outbreak Challenge – Epidemiological Data Analysis

**Scenario:**  
An infectious disease is spreading through London in 1854. Hundreds of people fall ill within days.  
No one knows the cause, many suspect “bad air”. You are scientists trying to find patterns in the data to understand **who is most affected** and **how the disease spreads**.

---

## Step 1: Explore the Data

Look at the **Overview** tab:
- How many data points (rows) are there?
- What variables are available? (age, gender, distance to pumps, etc.)
- Are there any **missing values**?

---

## Step 2: Visual Exploration

### a) Distributions (Stacked histogram)
- Choose one variable (e.g. age, occupation, nearest pump).  
- What does the **distribution** look like?  
- Which groups or bins have **more severe cases**?  
- For continuous variables, change the **bin width** with the slider on the left (bottom) — what happens?

### b) Heatmap (Compare two variables)
- Pick two variables (e.g. age vs. household size).  
- Which combinations show higher counts of illness?  
- Why might binning matter here?

### c) Scatter (No binning)
- Choose two **continuous** variables (e.g. Age vs. Distance to Pump A).  
- What patterns do you see when points are colored by health status?  
- Try changing filters using the menus on the left (gender, occupation, etc.): does the pattern get stronger or weaker?

## Step 3: Form a Hypothesis

Based on your visual exploration:
- Who seems most at risk?  
- Do you see hints of how the disease might spread?  
- What could be the **source**?

Write your hypothesis here:  
> _Example: People who eat less vegetables and live in households of 4 or more appear to get sick more often._

---

## Step 4: Test the Hypothesis (Statistical Check)

Go to the **Hypothesis & stats** tab:
- Which statistical tests are shown?  
- What do they tell you about **association** between factors and disease?  
- What does “correlation ≠ causation” mean in this context?  
  _(Can you think of other explanations for the pattern you saw? - Where could confounding be hiding?)_

---

## Step 5: Reflection

- What was your biggest discovery?  
- If you were a real scientist, what **next data** would you want to collect?  
- How might this kind of analysis help in **modern public health**?

💡 *Remember:* Data can show patterns, but not always causes. Science is about exploring, questioning, and testing ideas carefully.
